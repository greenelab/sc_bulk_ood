This project is done as part of a rotation project in the Greene Lab. It uses greenelab/sc_bulk_ood by Natalie Davidson code (created for single cell RNA-seq data from blood) and applies it into cortex tissue.

This project is still a work in progress. If you are interested in how the model works
on various types of input datasets (MNIST or simulated Bulk RNASeq), please refer to the experiments folder.

Full demos of the model, along with ways to train and test on larger real datasets will be added soon.
